# Power BI Dashboard Portfolio

This dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) including profit, costs, shipments, lost boxes, and sales, 
providing actionable insights for business operations. Data cleaning was performed using Power Query on Excel imports, 
and DAX was leveraged to create custom measures and workflow models for relational mapping. Below is a preview of the 
completed dashboard along with a video demonstration:
